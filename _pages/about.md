Hello!! I am Gustavo Meza! I hold a B.A. in Economics at Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP), and I am currently pursuing the Diploma of Specialization in Data Science for Social Sciences and Public Management. 

I am working as a economics and financial analyst at [SEMANAeconómica](https://semanaeconomica.com/autor/gustavo-meza); and in the past i have had worked as junior researcher, research assistant and economic consultant at [GERENS Gradute School](https://gerens.pe/). Also, I am currently colaborating with the [Competition Program](https://librecompetencia.uc.cl/investigacion) of the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (UC).

I have more than two years of experience in data analysis, as well as conducting quantitative and qualitative research. Additionally, I want to contribute to the design of public policies based on quantitative and qualitative evidence.

In my free time, I like to practice sports, listen to music and read.

Hello! I am Gustavo Meza. I hold a B.A. in Economics from Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP), where I also completed the Diploma of Specialization in Data Science for Social Sciences and Public Management.

I am currently working as a Senior Researcher at [Red de Estudios para el Desarrollo](http://https://www.redesarrollo.pe/). In the past, I worked as an Economics and Financial Analyst at [SEMANAeconómica](https://semanaeconomica.com/autor/gustavo-meza) and as a Junior Researcher, Research Assistant, and Economic Consultant at [GERENS Gradute School](https://gerens.pe/).

I have over 4 years of experience in economic analysis, where I have developed reports, presentations, and academic and consulting documents based on data-driven insights. I am skilled in managing databases and performing econometric modeling. Additionally, I have written articles for media like [El Comercio](https://elcomercio.pe/economia/la-mirada-inversion-privada-que-no-repunta-por-gustavo-meza-hinojo-noticia/) and [Rumbo Minero](https://www.rumbominero.com/revista/articulos/de-la-riqueza-al-desarrollo-mineria-impacto-socieconomico/), and conducted interviews on topics related to mining, hydrocarbons, education, health, transportation, macroeconomics, etc.
